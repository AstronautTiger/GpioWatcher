Graphical representation of the GPIO pins on Raspberry PI 2 Model B for Windows 10 IoT
This project is made for the Windows 10 IoT for Raspberry PI 2 Model B. 
It creates a graphical representation of the GPIO pin board on the bottom of the screen and shows the current pin status, 
high or low. Useful for debugging and finding out what state the pins are in during development. Pins can also be toggled by 
clicking them.
